# 2 Processing Step - Uppercasing

This is an oversimplified example of the NATS messaging system.

This service will do some transformation - in this case its some uppercasing.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```
## Running it

Note: the system expects a `.env` file in the root of the `json-to-db` floder containing the NATS_JWT value.
```
$ npm start 
```

## Running the tests
<!-- 
```
npm t
``` -->
Tests to come shortly.
